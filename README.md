# Excel-python
A collection of Python codes and MS-Excel UDF, made especially for Civil Engineering.


### Type of Excel/Python files

There are 2 main type of programs:
- Run as main
- UDF (User define functions)

Generally, the first one (Run as main) is more capable in terms of complexity. However, I was not able to fully utilize the capabilities in term of streaming data.

The second one feels like able to solve quicker type of problems, and integrating a more open type problem. In some, being able to create your one tools in Excel in a quick way.
